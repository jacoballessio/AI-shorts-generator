    "summary": "Jax is a high-performance array computing library for machine learning, developed by Google, that is similar to NumPy but with the added capabilities of automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation. Jax enforces immutable arrays and pure functions, allowing it to automatically compile to low-level code that can run on accelerated hardware like GPUs and TPUs. The A in Jax stands for Autograph, which allows for automatic differentiation of Python functions. This is useful for calculating gradients in machine learning algorithms. Jax also offers just-in-time compilation, which transforms functions into a primitive set of operations, lazily compiled, and evaluated like a functional programming language. To get started with Jax, users can install it for their CPU, GPU, or TPU and start performing high-performance array computing. Jax's automatic differentiation feature is particularly useful in machine learning, as it can be used to calculate the rate of change of a function with respect to its inputs, which is crucial in gradient-based optimization algorithms and neural networks. Jax can be used to build deep neural networks with libraries like Flax.",
