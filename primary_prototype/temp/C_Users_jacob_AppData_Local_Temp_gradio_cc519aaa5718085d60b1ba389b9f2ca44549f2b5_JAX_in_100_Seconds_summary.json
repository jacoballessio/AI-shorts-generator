    "summary": "Jax is a high-performance accelerated linear algebra library for numerical computing, similar to NumPy but with the addition of just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation, and constraints such as immutable arrays and pure functions. These features allow Jax to automatically compile code for accelerated hardware like GPUs and TPUs. Jax was developed by Google and team members from the original Autograph library and can be used for tasks such as automatic differentiation, which is useful for calculating gradients in machine learning algorithms like neural networks. Jax provides automatic differentiation through the Jax grad function, which computes the derivative of a function. By using Jax, developers can take advantage of high-performance computing for tasks such as calculating gradients, building deep neural networks, and optimizing machine learning models. Additionally, Jax can be used with other libraries such as Flax for building machine learning models.",
