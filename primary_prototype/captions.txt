Let's talk room temperature! It's not just about setting the thermostat to 21°C (70°F). Personal perception varies by gender, nationality, job satisfaction, and even the time of year. For instance, Japanese women prefer warmer temperatures than non-Japanese men. Seasons affect tolerance too—people bear higher temperatures in summer and feel warmer indoors during winter. Humidity also plays a role, making rooms feel warmer. So, achieving the perfect room temperature is a complex balancing act involving many factors. Next time you adjust your thermostat, remember: comfort isn't just a number!
